Use the output of the previous command to find the name and IP address of the device that makes the link between you (local network) and the outside world.

NAT allows multiple devices to access the Internet through a single public address;
process in which one or more local IP address is translated into one or more Global IP address and vice versa in order to provide Internet access to the local hosts

To get the IP address and name, we can use nslookup 10.60.1.1.

Result: 
Server:         10.51.1.253
Address:        10.51.1.253#53

1.1.60.10.in-addr.arpa  name = nat.hive.fi
