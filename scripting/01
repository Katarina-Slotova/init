# Write a script which displays only the login, UID and Path of each entry of the/etc/passwd file.
cat /etc/passwd | awk -F: '{print $1 $3 $7}'

# -F <value> - tells awk what field separator to use. -F: means that the separator is colon.
# field 6 is Home directory: This field contains the absolute path of the userâ€™s home directory.
# field 7 is Login shell: This field store the absolute path of the user shell. This shell is started when the user is log in to the system.
# It is my assumption, that in the subject they mean login shell by the "Path".
