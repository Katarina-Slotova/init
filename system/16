Find the service which makes it possible to run specific tasks following a regular schedule.

In Linux, the cron daemon runs tasks in the background at specified times.
To schedule a task using cron, a special file called crontab must be edited in a text editor - add the task in it in a particular format.
Then cron will run the task at the time specified in the crontab file.

Edit crontab: crontab -e
Choose editor (e.g. nano, vim)
Lines in the crontab are written in this format: minute(0-59) hour(0-23) day(1-31) month(1-12) weekday(0-6) command
Asterisk can be used to match any value

Example of crontab file:
SHELL=/bin/bash
PATH=/sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin
MAILTO=root
HOME=/
01 * * * * root run-parts /etc/cron.hourly
02 4 * * * root run-parts /etc/cron.daily
22 4 * * 0 root run-parts /etc/cron.weekly
42 4 1 * * root run-parts /etc/cron.monthly

run-parts executes scripts located in the directory provided as an argument (each at a different time)
